# Megaline - Statistical Data Analysis Project

    
In this project, I will be analyzing data from the telecom operator Megaline. I have data files containing some general information on a sample of users and their call, internet, and messaging behavior.

I start by loading and preparing the data for analysis, followed by analyzing the customers behavior, and test some hypotheses to help come to a conclusion on which phone plan generates more revenue for Megaline and where their advertising budgets should be allocated. 

I use the pandas, numpy, scipy, and matplotlib libraries for this project.
